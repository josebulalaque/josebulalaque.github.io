- Create raffle drafts, then draw winners later.
- Draw Minor raffles instantly or Major raffles with a suspense reveal (winner-by-winner).
- Optionally exclude previous winners from future draws with an eligible count indicator.
- Target raffle draws to everyone, family-only, or non-family participants.
- Generate random numbers with a fun food-themed reveal animation.
- Export participant lists as CSV.
- Switch between multiple UI themes (Default, Light, Dark, Barrio Fiesta variants, and more).
- Mobile-friendly layout across pages.
- Dashboard copy updated for a festive, raffle-focused tone.
