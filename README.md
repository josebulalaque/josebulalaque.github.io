# Raffler

Raffler is a lightweight web app for managing raffle participants, events, and draws. It runs entirely in the browser and stores data locally using localStorage.

## What it does
- Register participants with an auto-incrementing raffle number.
- Manage events and keep notes for upcoming sessions.
- Create raffle drafts, then draw winners later.
- Draw Minor raffles instantly or Major raffles with a suspense reveal (winner-by-winner).
- Optionally exclude previous winners from future draws with an eligible count indicator.
- Export participant lists as CSV.
- Switch between multiple UI themes (Default, Light, Dark, Barrio Fiesta variants, and more).
- Mobile-friendly layout across pages.

## Pages
- Dashboard: live stats and recent activity.
- Participants: add names and view the list.
- Events: create and manage events.
- Raffles: create drafts, draw winners later, and review results (Show Winners popup).
- Settings: choose a theme.

## How to run
Open `index.html` in a browser.

## Data storage
All data is stored locally in your browser (localStorage). No server required.
